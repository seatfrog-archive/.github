# Seatfrog Archive

This organisation contains repos that aren't currently in use but we just can't bear to delete them.

Repositories that belong here are ones which we no longer use, or projects that we started on but aren't actively working on.

We want the github.com/seatfrog to represent everything we're currently running in production. If your project didn't make it to production, isn't being worked on, and isn't scheduled to be worked on in the next four sprints it belongs in here.

Don't worry, you can always resurrect it when you're ready!
